# Maasu-STM-32-Internship
Welcome to the MAASU Internship 4 repository, dedicated to hands-on C/C++ programming for the STM32F411RET6 microcontroller.

This repository is created for the MAASU Internship program, focusing on firmware development for the STM32F411RET6 microcontroller. It includes projects related to GPIO, USART, PWM, and other peripherals, with detailed examples and documentation. The repository aims to guide interns through hands-on embedded systems development, covering both theory and practical implementation.

I actively contributed to the design, implementation, and documentation of the following key modules:

✅ USART – Initialization, data transmission/reception, and interrupt-based communication
✅ TIMER – Timer configuration for periodic tasks and delay functionality
✅ GPIO – Pin setup, input/output logic, and alternate function mapping
✅ CLOCK – System clock configuration including PLL and prescalers for desired frequencies
These modules were developed with attention to register-level control, modular C code structure, and inline documentation to support learning and reuse.
